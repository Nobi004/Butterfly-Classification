# Butterfly-Classification
#  1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background
Butterflies play a crucial role in ecosystems, particularly in pollination, that maintains plant reproduction and food. Their diversity and abundance are critical indicators of the health of ecosystems since they are very sensitive to environmental changes. Species identification of butterflies, however, is a tedious and challenging task because there are detailed and similar patterns of wings on different species and great intra-class variation due to factors like environment and level of development. This makes the process of identification greatly dependent on professional knowledge, which may not be readily available all the time.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
This project suggests automating the species recognition of butterflies by deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The idea is to create an automated system that can classify butterfly images into 75 species correctly. By automating this, we can overcome the constraints imposed by hand identification and render it more efficient and public-friendly, as well as accessible to conservationists and researchers.

##  1.3 Objectives
 - Train a deep learning model to recognize images of butterflies into 75 species.
 - Enhance model performance through transfer learning from pre-trained CNN models and data augmentation techniques.
 - Host the trained model as a web-based application for the identification of real-time butterfly species from uploaded images.

## 1.4 Significance
Butterfly species identification automation has enormous potential for the conservation of biodiversity. By providing a quick, scalable method of species identification, this system can assist researchers and conservationists in tracking and monitoring butterfly populations, especially rare and endangered species. Furthermore, the project encourages citizen science through enabling the public to participate in biodiversity tracking, allowing data collection from different localities. Furthermore, this device can be utilized as an automatic research tool for ecological and entomological studies to collect scale data and perform analysis.
